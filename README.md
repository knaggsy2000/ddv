# Danny's Digital Voice (DDV)

A alternative digital voice system for the modern world of amateur/ham radio. Uses GMSK modulation at 9600 bits/s using the Speex/Codec2 codec.

This is currently under development and experimentation - as I need to perfect my GMSK modem first (used for my DDP project). The circuit for the modem will also be released, features so far: RS-232 interface, direct connection to your rig using 9600 baud data connection. Uses standard "of the shelf" components, currently no PICs are used.




Status: Alpha

Supported OS: FreeBSD, Linux, and other Unix-like OS'es

Supported Hardware: Any modem (custom built or commercial) interfaced to your PC via RS-232 which can connect to your transceiver at 9600 baud

Technology Backend: DDP (>= v0.6.1)
